					<h2>How It Started?</h2>
					<p>So you're here to learn more about me. Excellent! I love talking about myself üòù.</p>
					<p>How did I get into tech? Well, I first discovered my passion for coding in my second year of University. I was majoring in Pure Mathematics,
					and had a C programming course. At the time, I had no idea about coding, but it was the only course I was excited about learning.</p>
					<p>Without any second thoughts, I decided to change my major into Computer Science and since then, this amazing journey started.</p>
					<p>I love learning new things. Naturally, tech was the perfect place to be. It‚Äôs always changing and always moving forward.</p>
					<p>Some people might find this overwhelming but I love it. You‚Äôll never run out of things to learn.</p>
					<p>Feel free to check <a href="internships.html">my learning journey.</a></p>

					<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
					<p><b>Wondering about how I spend my spare time?</b> I do different things, depending on how I'm feeling.</p>
					<p>I either spend it reading, I like reading comics and manga's.</p>
					<p>Or drawing, I love drawing. It started years ago with cartoon's drawings and then developed to drawing portraits and painting.
					I also lately started digital drawing and I like to improve more my skills. </p>
					<p>I also bake and always watch videos to learn some new recipes.</p>
					<p>Or I spend it going through my social media accounts.</p>
